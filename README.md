A place for me to put examples of my work.

MagicProject.pdf is a report I cowrote comparing two machine learning algorithms and their effectiveness at sorting Magic: The Gathering cards by color combination. M:TG is a collectible card game in which every card can be any combination of five colors, and these color combinations have broad implications on how the card works when played. Our random forest model was able to effectively guess the color combinations of cards based on statistics of the cards like words in their text-box.

MagicProject.rmd is the RMarkdown file which produces MagicProject.pdf.
