A hub for some examples of my work.

'HowToFindBigfoot' is a twelve-page report on datasets of bigfoot-sighting a UFO-report data across North America.

'Witch Trial Project' is a forty-page report about a database of scottish witchtrials I made in SQL Server Management Studio. 

'MagicProject.rmd' an RMarkdown file producing 'Magic Project,' a report I cowrote comparing two machine learning algorithms and their effectiveness at sorting Magic: The Gathering cards by color combination, a highly complicated quality. Our random forest model was able to effectively guess the color combinations of cards based on statistics of the cards like words in their text-box. Check github.com/TedTinker/DataMining for more projects from this data mining course.

'senior_thesis' is a LaTeX file producing 'Senior Thesis,' a forty-page report on De Bruijn sequences. I advance the notion of a universal cycle from one- and two-dimensional examples to three-dimenional cases and beyond. 

De-Bruijn-Examples is a series of interactive demonstrations of De Bruijn sequences and arrays. Try cloning the file into a Jupyter Notebook to explore the De Bruijn property in three dimensions! 

Also check tedtinker.github.io/BugFlipper for the website I built for BugFlipper, a Python plug-in I wrote for the Cheadle Center for Biodiversity and Ecological Restoration.
