A hub for examples of my work.

De-Bruijn-Examples is a series of interactive demonstrations of De Bruijn sequences and arrays. Clone the file into a Jupyter Notebook to explore the De Bruijn property in three dimensions! 

MagicProject.pdf is a report I cowrote comparing two machine learning algorithms and their effectiveness at sorting Magic: The Gathering cards by color combination, a highly complicated quality. Our random forest model was able to effectively guess the color combinations of cards based on statistics of the cards like words in their text-box.

MagicProject.rmd is the RMarkdown file which produces MagicProject.pdf. Check github.com/TedTinker/DataMining for more projects from this data mining course.

Senior_Thesis.pdf is my forty-page report on De Bruijn sequences. I advance the notion of a universal cycle from one- and two-dimensional examples to three-dimenional cases and beyond. 

Senior_Thesis is the LaTeX file which produces Senior_Thesis.pdf.

Also check tedtinker.github.io/BugFlipper for the website I built for BugFlipper, a Python plug-in I wrote for the Cheadle Center for Biodiversity and Ecological Restoration.
